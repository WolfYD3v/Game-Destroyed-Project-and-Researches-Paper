DREAM 5 : Unconscious dialogue lines :

[INTRO] Just walk
Welcome to the museum of the unreperable
Today you will discover a place of wonders
Wonders of the fantasic 'Broken' exposition

This art piece is called 'Broken I, Self-Confidence' . His name talks for herself .

I love this creation . 'Broken II, Vision of my own' is so deap in his narration . I think you agree with me .

Aaah , 'Broken III, Bad Others' . The artist shows a fear of others in this painting . Or just an incomprehension . We don't really know .

What a great exposition .
Should I show you the best pieces of art we got ?
Follow me .
Just walk .

Here it is , 'Broken VII, Pile of nothing' . This creation is the Joconde of our museum . What do you see ? A pile of nothing ? Or something with coherence ?

And our baby . 'Broken X, The REASON why I am here' . Our Tour Eiffel , our Palais de Versailles , your REASON for coming here .

Oh look , is this THE artist , your deny ?
He work a lot to make masterpieces for the exposition .
How ? By destroying .
